## Github
Today, I signed up for a Github account and looked at several tutorials on Youtube to familiarize myself with its working, learning Git commands like clone, add, commit, push, and pull.

Two really good guides that I found are here for reference:

I learned how to link up Visual Studio Code, the Github desktop version and Github in the browser. I created a sample repository and wrote this md file in VSC and then added and commmited the changes on my local device and pushed them to the repository on Github.
